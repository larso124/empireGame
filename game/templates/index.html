    Your empire name can be a character, celebrity, historical figure, etc.! <br>
    It should be a name that anyone in the room COULD know, theoretically <br> -
    if they had read that book, watched that show, or paid attention in class. <br>
    So, don't make up a name or enter an improper noun :)
